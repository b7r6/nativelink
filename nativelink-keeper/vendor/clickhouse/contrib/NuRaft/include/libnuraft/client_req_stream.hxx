/**
 * Pipelined forwarding of client requests to the current leader.
 * Traffic is pinned to a single persistent `rpc_client`
 * (one TCP connection) and a single leader term number.
 *
 * Entries sent through one stream get committed in the original
 * order (possibly interleaved with entries from other sources),
 * with no skipped entries. I.e. some prefix of the sequence of
 * entries ends up committed. E.g. if you send 3 entries ABC, the
 * log may end up with nothing, A, AB, or ABC (most likely).
 *
 * Obtain via `raft_server::open_client_req_stream`.
 *
 * `append` is not thread-safe. Callers must serialize concurrent
 * calls externally. On a non-pipelining transport
 * (`rpc_client::supports_pipelining() == false`) the caller must
 * additionally wait for is_ready() to become true, indicating that
 * the previous RPC has returned.
 *
 * On any error or leader term change, the stream becomes
 * "abandoned", and the caller has to create a new stream.
 *
 * RPC results are not reported. Instead, the caller is expected
 * to separately monitor committed entries and match them with
 * previously submitted append requests. And to frequently check
 * is_abandoned(); if the stream is abandoned, the remaining
 * in-flight requests may or may not be eventually committed, and
 * future requests will be dropped.
 *
 * Lifetime: the stream must not outlive its `raft_server`.
 *
 * Note: in contrast to this class, auto-forwarding
 *       (raft_params::auto_forwarding_) dispatches through an
 *       `rpc_client` pool, so concurrent requests may reach the
 *       leader out of order.
